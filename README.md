# MSAA

> #### Source code for some of the results shown in the paper "Enhanced Three-Dimensional Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using a Multi-Strategy Snow Avalanches Algorithms"submitted in The Visual Computer in 2025.This is aimed at researchers, students or profesionnals who may want to reproduce some of the results described in the paper.


## CEC2022 test problems
> This repository contains all test instances of CEC2022 issues.
> The CEC document includes discussions regarding the MSAA algorithm presented in this paper in the context of CEC2022 benchmark functions.
> The input_data22 file constitutes the test dataset generated during the evaluation of algorithms associated with the CEC2022 benchmark functions described in the paper. 

## Three-Dimensional Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
> This repository also includes examples of Three-Dimensional Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
> The code repository includes comprehensive implementations for 3D UAV path planning, encompassing model construction, visualization, and the MSAA algorithm (implemented in the ISAA.m script).
